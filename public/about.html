<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Settled in the scenic town of Caldwell, Idaho, I am an avid lover of Thai cuisine and its vibrant flavors. This passion
   led me to start my very own Thai Food Truck, bringing the rich and aromatic tastes of Thailand to the streets of Caldwell.</p>

<p>However, my interests don't just stop at food. I am deeply intrigued by the world of game development and have been
   dedicating my time to learning Unity. Crafting new worlds, characters, and gameplay mechanics is something that resonates
    deeply with my creative side. With every new project, I aim to bridge the gap between my visions and the final product on screen.</p>

<p>But life isn't just about play. In a bid to blend my managerial skills from running a food truck with a more data-driven 
  approach, I am diving head-first into the realm of Data Analytics. My goal is to bring about efficient and impactful changes in my business strategies using insights drawn from data. Moreover, I am working towards honing my skills for junior-level game development, to take my passion a step further into the professional world.</p>

<p>When I am not serving up delicious Thai food or developing the next big game, you can find me in spirited conversations 
  about ChatGPT, best management practices, and game development techniques. I believe in perpetual learning and am always 
  eager to engage, learn, and grow.</p>

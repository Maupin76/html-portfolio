<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Goodwill Hunting</h3>
<p>Why I liked this movie...I love how a kid that comes from nothing has an amazing brain and works through some personal issues that I 
    can relate to, in a matter of speaking.
</p>
<h3>Tombstone</h3>
<p>Why I liked this movie...I love movies and I love movies that make me feel like I am there. Taking this old western and great acting
    you get a sense of what it was like to be there. Plus I love the actors they have chosen for this movie.
</p>
<h3>Avatar(2009)</h3>
<p>Why I like this movie...As I have stated before, I love movies that make me feel like I am there. Avatar had such amazing color and ideas
    with the environment, that I wish some of those things could be real.

<p>***It is really hard to say which type of movie is my favorite since I am a lover of almost all types of movies. Movies take me away from
    the everyday grind of the real world and just gives your mind something else to think about.
